Every August there is always a excitement among football fans as the club football returns for the new season with a bang across Europe.Teams will have to face new challenges ahead of them.

Premier League is one of the toughest competition across top 5 European leagues.From title challenges to local derbies to relegation battles it is always a hell of a ride for all the teams

Let's look at some interesting numbers at 2022/23 season via data from transfer market,football reference etc.

# Chelsea FC Signings

From sacking Thomas Tuchel and new takeover of the club ,Chelsea season has been a complete disaster. They have spent the most in the transfer market.Let us look at some of their top transfers

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(worldfootballR)
library(patchwork)
library(png)
library(magick)

library(grid)
```

```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
data=read.csv('Transfers.csv')

#Formatting nos to currncy
val<- function(x) {
  dplyr::case_when(
    x < 1e3 ~ as.character(x),
    x < 1e6 ~ paste0(as.character(x/1e3), "K"),
    x < 1e9 ~ paste0(as.character(x/1e6), "M"),
    TRUE ~ "To be implemented..."
  )
}

# dat %>% View()

data <- data %>% mutate(
  Transfer_Fee=val(transfer_fee)
)

```

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.width=10,fig.height=8, fig.cap="Chelsea 2022/23 Transfers",warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

#Chelsea Signings 2022-23 season
chelsea=data %>% dplyr::filter(team_name == "Chelsea FC" & transfer_type=="Arrivals" & transfer_fee>0)
chelsea$Transfer_Fee<-sub("M", "",chelsea$Transfer_Fee)
chelsea$Transfer_Fee<-as.numeric(chelsea$Transfer_Fee)

ggplot(data = chelsea, aes(x = reorder(player_name, Transfer_Fee), y = Transfer_Fee)) +
  geom_col(fill = "blue") + # Add text labels to the bars
  coord_flip() +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, "M")) +  # Add "M" to y-axis labels

  labs(title="Chelsea Top Transfers 22/23",caption ="By Hari Krishna")+xlab("")
```

Top signings of Chelsea include the likes of Enzo Fernandez,Fofana ,Mudryk.

Some of their signings experienced an absence of numbers appearing on the pitch like Aubameyang and Sterling who are experienced in the Premier league.

Two horse title race between Arsenal and City was the major headline last season.Arsenal were really in control till game week 29 and then 3 consecutive draws which proved very costly in hunt for the title where they failed to capitalize 2-0 lead in 2 of the matches and also drew against Southampton 3-3 at home. Arsenal went on to win only 3 of their last 6 games

City meanwhile were consistent after game week 24 where they have not lost a single game until the final match week to BrentFord(only side to beat city twice in the 2022/23 season).But from the above graph we can also see that from match week (16-22) city lost 3 games and drew 1 but were consistent after that till the business end of the tournament which helped them to win hatt-rick of PL titles.

Erling Haaland in his first season won the golden boot and his numbers were phenomenal.
