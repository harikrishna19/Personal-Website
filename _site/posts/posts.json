They have spent the most in the\r\ntransfer market.Let us look at some of their top transfers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Chelsea 2022/23 Transfers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop signings of Chelsea include the likes of Enzo Fernandez,Fofana\r\n,Mudryk.\r\nSome of their signings experienced an absence of numbers appearing on\r\nthe pitch like Aubameyang and Sterling who are experienced in the\r\nPremier league.\r\nTitle Race:Man City-Arsenal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Title Race 2022/23 Transfers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo horse title race between Arsenal and City was the major headline\r\nlast season.Arsenal were really in control till game week 29 and then 3\r\nconsecutive draws which proved very costly in hunt for the title where\r\nthey failed to capitalize 2-0 lead in 2 of the matches and also drew\r\nagainst Southampton 3-3 at home. Arsenal went on to win only 3 of their\r\nlast 6 games\r\nCity meanwhile were consistent after game week 24 where they have not\r\nlost a single game until the final match week to BrentFord(only side to\r\nbeat city twice in the 2022/23 season).But from the above graph we can\r\nalso see that from match week (16-22) city lost 3 games and drew 1 but\r\nwere consistent after that till the business end of the tournament which\r\nhelped them to win hatt-rick of PL titles.\r\nErling Haaland in his first season won the golden boot and his\r\nnumbers were phenomenal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
